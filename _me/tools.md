# Tools

## Productivity
- To take notes I use [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/). I try to take "smart" notes in an adopted version of the Zettelkasten-System by Niklas Luhmann
- I use [Asana](https://app.asana.com/) to remind myself of projects and keep an overview of my tasks
- Recently, I made the switch from [Citavi]( https://www.citavi.com/) to [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) because it is open source; and so far, I like it a lot
- For office tasks I mostly use Microsoft office
- I am quite comfortable using the Adobe Suite: Photoshop, Illustrator, Lightroom (however, I am not a professional)

## Stats and Programming
- I try to mostly use [R Statistical Computing](https://www.r-project.org/) to analyze my data. On this blog I post regularly about my best practice for analyzing data in R
- If necessary, Iâ€™m also comfortable using SPSS and AMOS
- For coding I use Visual Studio Code and the Arduino IDE
- Before I made the change to [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) I used [Wordpress]( https://wordpress.com/) for webdev

## Homebrew
- I run two home servers: a debian server running OMW and a rasperry pi 3b running raspbian OS. I use it mostly to "self-host" webapps in docker containers like grafana, node red, homeassistant, pihole, openVPN and many more...
