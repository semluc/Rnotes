# Tools

## Productivity
- To take notes, I use [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/). I also use obsidian for project management.
- Recently, I made the switch from [Citavi]( https://www.citavi.com/) to [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/).
- For office tasks, I mostly use Microsoft office
- I am quite comfortable using the Adobe Suite: Photoshop, Illustrator, Lightroom (however, I am not a professional)

## Stats and Programming
- I mostly use [R Statistical Computing](https://www.r-project.org/) to analyze my data. On this blog I post about my best practice for analyzing data in R
- If necessary, Iâ€™m also comfortable using SPSS and AMOS
- For coding I use Visual Studio Code and the Arduino IDE
- Before I made the change to [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) I used [Wordpress]( https://wordpress.com/)

## Homebrew
- I run two home servers: a debian server running OMW and a rasperry pi 3b running raspbian OS. I use it mostly to self-host webapps in docker containers, like grafana, node red, homeassistant, pihole, openVPN and many more...
